## 📂 Structure & Summary of Tasks

| Folder / Task | Title | Description | Techniques & Tools |
|---------------|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Task1** | Student Score Prediction | Predict students' exam scores based on study hours (simple regression) | Linear Regression, scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn |
| **Task2** | Customer Segmentation | Segment customers based on purchasing behavior | K-Means Clustering, Feature Scaling, Elbow Method, Pandas, Seaborn |
| **Task3** | Forest Cover Type Classification | Classify forest cover types using environmental features | Random Forest & Tree-based Models, Train-Test Split, scikit-learn, Pandas |
| **Task4** | Loan Approval Prediction | Predict whether loan applicants will be approved | Logistic Regression & Other Classifiers, Model Evaluation, Confusion Matrix |

## ⚙️ Tech Stack & Tools

- **Python** — primary programming language  
- **Pandas & NumPy** — data manipulation and preprocessing  
- **scikit-learn** — regression, clustering, classification, evaluation metrics  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** — interactive experimentation  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** — visualization of data & insights  
- **Streamlit** — for building simple interactive dashboards  

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Add interactive dashboards (e.g., using **Plotly** or **Streamlit**).  
- Conduct deeper **statistical analysis** and **feature engineering**.  
- Integrate more advanced models (e.g., **XGBoost ).  
- Deploy models or visualizations as a **web application**.

## 🚀 How to Run the Application  

1. Open your terminal (**CMD**, **PowerShell**, or **Git Bash**).  
2. Navigate to the project directory.  
3. Run the following command:  

```bash
streamlit run app.py
