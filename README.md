##  Tech Stack & Tools

- **Python** â€” primary programming language  
- **Pandas & NumPy** â€” for data manipulation and preprocessing  
- **scikit-learn** â€” modeling (regression, clustering, classification) and evaluation  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** â€” interactive development environment  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** â€” for visualizing data and insights

### Future Enhancements

Add a more interactive dashboard (e.g., using Plotly or Streamlit).

Conduct deeper statistical analysis or feature engineering.

Integrate more advanced models (e.g., XGBoost ).

Deploy models or visualizations as a web app.

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Application  

1. Open your terminal (**CMD**, **PowerShell**, or **Git Bash**).  
2. Navigate to the project directory.  
3. Run the following command:  

```bash
streamlit run app.py
