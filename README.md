##  Tech Stack & Tools

- **Python** — primary programming language  
- **Pandas & NumPy** — for data manipulation and preprocessing  
- **scikit-learn** — modeling (regression, clustering, classification) and evaluation  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** — interactive development environment  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** — for visualizing data and insights

### Future Enhancements

Add a more interactive dashboard (e.g., using Plotly or Streamlit).

Conduct deeper statistical analysis or feature engineering.

Integrate more advanced models (e.g., XGBoost ).

Deploy models or visualizations as a web app.
